### One:	How to installation and configuration environment.
> 1. Download and install Java JDK 8.
> 
>	 	You	can Download here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html
>		Then:  Run the command 'java -version' in your terminal to check the version of Java is correct
>	2. Download IntelliJ Community Edition.
> 
>		You can Download here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac

### Four:	The principle behind the system
>	1.Built in TDD approach

>		2. Then constructed the smallest feasible solution
>		3. Next, based on each story card by using 'AS A.., I want.., SO THAT...'. 
>		4. Repeat The TDD Cycle:	
>			Write a Test -> complie -> fix complie errors -> run failing test -> write code -> run all tests -> refator -> write a test -> ...
>	2.Use Object-Oriented Programming principles in writing well-structured code
>
>	3.Use small commits during development
